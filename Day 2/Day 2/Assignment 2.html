        <p>
            Hassan District is one of the 30 districts of Karnataka 
            state located in the south-western part of Karnataka in India.
             The district has had an eventful and rich history. In the past, 
             it reached the height of its glory during the rule of the Hoysalas
              who had their capital at Dwarasamudra, the modern Halebeed in Belur Taluk.
               The district, noted for its enchanting natural scenic beauty is also a veritable
                treasure-house of Hoysala architecture and sculpture, the best specimens of which 
                are at Belur and Halebeed. Shravanabelagola, in Channarayapatna taluk, which is
                 studded with Jain moduments, is a renowned centre of pilgrimage for the jains.

            Like most of the other districts in the State, this district
             also derives its name from its headquarters town, Hassan. According
              to the Sthalapurana, the name ‘Hassan’ is a contraction or derivative
               of ‘Simhasanapura’, associated with janamejaya, a great grandson of the
                Pandava hero, Arjuna. But the popular belief is that the place is called
                 Hassan after the goddess Hassan-amma or Hasanamba, the presiding deity of 
                 the local Hasanamba temple situated in the old town area. Hasanamma or Hasanamba means,
                  in Kannada, a smiling mother or goddess. In this connection, a traditional story, 
                  as to how the goddess Hasanamba came to be established at this place, is narrated thus :
                   The Saptamatrikas (seven mothers or goddesses), in the course of their journey
                    from Varasasi (Kashi) to the South, were pleased with the scenic splendour of this 
                    area and decided to make it their abode. Accordingly, of the seven mothers,
                     who were sisters, three settled at Hassan and another three in a tank called Devigere,
                      also in Hassan proper, and were called Hasanamba, while the other one settled in a forest near
             Kenchammana-Hosakote in Alur taluk and was called Kenchamba.
