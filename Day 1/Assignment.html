            It is believed that the city Mysore derived its name
             from Mahishasura (an enormous demon) who was the ruler of
              this province for a long term. Finally, he was beaten by the Goddess 
              Chamundeshwari and this province became demon free. Now, Mysore City is
               the headquarters of Mysore District, located in Deccan Plateau of south India
